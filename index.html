      <div class="bio">
        <p>In my upbringing I was surrounded by art and technology. My Mother was a costume designer, creating wonderful garments for film and stage, my Grandmother was a web designer, creating websites beyond imagination. Watching these women, I was exposed to a world of art and technology from an early age.</p>

        <p>Design has always been something that piqued my interest, seeing as it isn’t found in one form. I would see the intricate costume designs, with the only limiting factor being the material you could get your hands on. Web designs however, really caught my eye. There was no limiting factor. I just had to learn. If I could learn different techniques and gain competency in different programming languages then I could do anything.</p>
          
        <p>Knowing that all I had to do was gain the knowledge, I went to school to earn my Associates of Arts in Visual Communication, it was the first step in becoming proficient in UI Design. From there I decided to continue my education with a Bachelors in Web Development where I could learn more about how to use HTML, CSS, Javascript.</p>
          
        <p>Having this knowledge at my disposal, I have been able to work with multiple clients to create fully branded websites. Using both CMS as well as plain HTML and CSS.</p>
          
        <p>Communication with any client is key, as is guiding them to make informed decisions. To design for someone you obviously need to know what they want but it’s a bit more than that. Anyone can say that they want a blue ‘B’ in their logo but getting to know the client and knowing their goals as a brand and how they want to present themselves within that brand will elevate it from just a blue ‘B’ to something that speaks to them and their customers. Furthermore you might get customers who know what they want but aren't aware of the design process and there are times where you need to inform them of different options that might better align with their vision.</p>
          
        <p>That being said, graphic design is my passion. It fuses art and technology in a way that I could never have imagined. Being within this industry professionally for almost four years has given me the opportunity to use the knowledge I've gained and further that knowledge. I've been able to design for diverse clientele, from Realtors to small business. Designing for such a diverse group of companies has given me techniques which allow me to access each clients wishes and deliver beyond expectations.</p>
